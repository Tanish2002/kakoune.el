* kakoune.el
A very simple simulation of kakoune inside of emacs. Most of the heavy lifting is provided by [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/ryo-modal][ryo-modal-mode]], [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple-cursors.el]], and [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]].

** Goals
   This is not meant to be a feature-complete emulation of kakoune, like evil is to vim. Evil is a massive undertaking, which reimplements a huge number of editing primitives from scratch. By contrast, kakoune.el uses emacs's native behavior wherever possible. In particular, it binds absolutely no keys in "insert mode." You'll have to bind one yourself to ryo-modal-mode.
